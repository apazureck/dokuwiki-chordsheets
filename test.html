        [Verse]
        C
        Someone told me long ago
        C                                   G
        There&#039;s a calm before the storm, I know
                             C
        And it&#039;s been coming for some time
        C
        When it&#039;s over, so they say
        C                          G
        It&#039;ll rain a sunny day, I know
                           C  
        Shining down like water
        
        [Chorus]
        F         G
        I wanna know
                 C    C/B      Am    Am/G
        Have you ever seen the rain
        F         G
        I wanna know
                 C    C/B      Am    Am/G
        Have you ever seen the rain
        F        G               C  
        Coming down on a sunny day

        C
        Yesterday and days before
        C                                G
        Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know
                            C 
        Been that way for all my time
        C
        &#039;Til forever on it goes
        C                                 G
        Thru the circle fast and slow, I know
                               C 
        And it can&#039;t stop, I wonder
        
        [Chorus]
        F         G
        I wanna know
                 C    C/B      Am    Am/G
        Have you ever seen the rain
        F         G
        I wanna know
                 C    C/B      Am    Am/G
        Have you ever seen the rain
        F        G                C  
        Coming down on a sunny day
        
        [Chorus]
        F         G
        I wanna know
                 C    C/B      Am    Am/G
        Have you ever seen the rain
        F         G
        I wanna know
                 C    C/B      Am    Am/G
        Have you ever seen the rain
